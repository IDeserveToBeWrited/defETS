	# Several changes have been made in v1.33:

	# - Suspension springing linearity curves recalibrated and made slightly progressive to simulate air springs
	# - Chassis suspension damping linearity curve recalibrated to simulate different compression and rebound behaviour
	# - Chassis suspension travel and working point recalibrated to mimic actual real-life parameters	
	# - Maximum steering lock increased slightly to calibrate trucks' turning circles
	# - Braking curve made more linear to better simulate actual braking behaviour at lower speeds
	# - Cabin suspension and damping reworked
	# - Cabin mass increased to 650kg for better simulation accuracy
	# - Wheel mass reduced for better accuracy
	# - Chassis suspension damping adjusted for better accuracy
	# - Trailer suspension reworked with resistant forces applied at the fifth wheel to replicate the effects of trailer chassis flex	
	
	# Further physics improvements are constantly in the works to improve the driving simulation in-game.

	# These coeficients are used for computing autocentering wheel speed.
	# The faster vehicle moves and the more steering wheel is turned left or right
	# the higher autocentering speed is.
	# Given value of speed_coef is for 100km/h velocity (linear raise).
	# Given value of angle_coef is for maximum wheel turn (30degrees, linear raise).
	# Returning speed coeficient is computed by multiplication of both coeficients.
	# When result coeficient is 1, returning speed is exactly the same as full
	# turning speed. This balance points define natural limits of steering
	# dependent on vehicle speed.
	# Ratio_coef defines upper limit of result coeficient (ratio against player).
