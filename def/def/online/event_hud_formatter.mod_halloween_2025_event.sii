# Definition For Formatting Xmas WoTr Events
#
# Could be expanded in the future to be hold formatting information on different types of events and delivery goals
#
# In this case each goal is a company that needs to be delivered to or from (or as the Xmas event defines).
# The progress is fetched via the wotr_event_manager and mapping the completion of each individual company on the lower 16 bits of the player progress,
# in the order defined on each event_format_data unit.
# This order is provided by Komat before the start of each event.
# The upper 16 bits are a count of the cities, for the player progress all completed or deliveries up until this point of the event, 
# and for the max progress the overall ammount of goals to be completed for the personal reward.
