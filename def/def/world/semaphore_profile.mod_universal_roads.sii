#	Special profile with swaped offset of cycle for cases like 'un_14059' (which is a SideWalk prefab) that is connected to another prefab integrated 
#	with its semaphore system. However, it must distinguish between major and minor road, hence the swapped timing to keep 
# 	ID on AI locators the same, avoiding the need to create a new prefab, and simplify for mapdesigners to just swap semaphore profile.
