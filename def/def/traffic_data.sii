	## Global AI safety modifier - influences 'safety factor' for all AI vehicles
	## Valid values: <-1;1>  where '-1' means 'minimum safety for all' and '1' means 'maximum safety for all'
	## Vehicles with low safety factor tend to brake more abruptly, use low spacing distances, use lights later in case of low visibility...
	#
	# ai_safety_modifier: 0.3

	## Global AI patience modifier - influences 'patience factor' for all AI vehicles
	## Valid values: <-1;1>  where '-1' means 'minimum patience for all' and '1' means 'maximum patience for all'
	## Vehicles with low patience factor tend to overtake more often, have lower waiting times (e.g. when yielding), use horns sooner (when blocked)...
	#
	# ai_patience_modifier: 0.0

	## Horn and blink delay intervals - how long before an AI vehicle uses its horn (e.g. when blocked)
	## or lights (e.g. when yielding) to notify other vehicle about something
	## The actual value used depends on vehicle's 'patience factor': lower patience -> lower delay
	#
	# ai_horn_delay: (4.0, 8.0)
	# ai_blink_delay: (3.0, 6.0)

	## Yield attributes. If a vehicle (including player's one) is forced to give way to other ones for too long time, a 'yield event' can occur.
	## This should help reducing traffic jams, which can occur at small roads during rush hours.
	## To make a vehicle yield to another one, the following conditions must be met:
	##
	## 1. Vehicles must be on 'small roads' (max 1 lane in each direction)
	## 2. The speed of the driving vehicle must not be higher than 'ai_yield_max_speed' [m/s]
	## 3. The waiting vehicle must have been waiting at least 'ai_yield_wait_time' [s].
	## 4. Yielding vehicle waits for the other one until it moves, but only for 'ai_yield_timeout' [s]. If nothing happens, yielding is cancelled.
	##
	## The actual values used depend on yielding vehicle's 'patience factor':
	#
	# ai_yield_max_speed: (18.0, 26.0)      # lower patience -> lower speed
	# ai_yield_wait_time: (20.0, 30.0)      # lower patience -> higher wait time
	# ai_yield_timeout: (3.0, 5.0)          # lower patience -> lower timeout


	## Obsolete attributes:
	#
	# mass_truck: 10500.0  		# the attribute is obsolete - mass is now set per-vehicle
	# mass_trailer: 20000.0  	# the attribute is obsolete - mass is now set per-vehicle
	# mass_car: 2000.0  		# the attribute is obsolete - mass is now set per-vehicle
	# max_truck_count: 4		# the attribute is obsolete - vehicle max count is now set per vehicle type

	# ai_displacement_curve_coef: 0.65 # limit curve displacement in curves

	## Drag length limits - virtually 'shortens' vehicles/trailers to allow then to turn in sharp curves
	## This attribute affects only on vehicles/trailers which are LONGER than the values set.
	## The side effect of 'shortening' is that vehicles/trailers slide to sides when turning.
	## It is more noticeable when the real length is much bigger than the limit
